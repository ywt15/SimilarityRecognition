Data similarity recognition (symbol, curve, waveform)



My other plug-in "Image Similarity Recognition", the main image object.


Video : https://youtu.be/hw_bUaps0Vw

Uses the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) method to identify the similarity degree of two-dimensional vector array progress.

Can be used for gesture \ pattern \ symbol \ shape \ waveform recognition.

Draw different symbols to release matching magic.

Identification is related to data order.
